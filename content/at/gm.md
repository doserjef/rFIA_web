We used `rFIA` to estimate average recruitment, mortality, and removal rates for trees ($DBH >= 12.7 cm$), with associated sampling errors, within ecoregion subsections which surround the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. We produced estimates for each FIA reporting year which was common among all states included in the analysis (2005-2016, with the exception of 2008).
