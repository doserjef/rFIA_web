Now and into the future national parks need to use sound scientific data to identify best management practices of their resources to adapt to changes in the environment. This is especially so in an era where a variety of threats and stressors affect park forests and associated resources that can result in increased operational costs for parks to ensure visitor safety and preserve park infrastructure. Worldwide, temperate deciduous forests have been highly altered and possess the highest index of human disturbance of any major biome, and high indices of fragmentation. The eastern United States is no exception, where temperate deciduous forests have been heavily used for timber, cleared for agriculture, or converted into towns and cities. The region through which Appalachian National Scenic Trail (AT) passes is predominantly forested and key stressors of these forest resources include land use change and habitat fragmentation on lands adjacent to the AT corridor, nonnative species, visitor usage, wet and dry deposition, and climate change. 

Using rFIA, we leverage the Forest Inventory and Analysis database to assess the status and trends in forest condition along the AT and neighboring lands. Specifically, we estimate the status and trends of the following attributes within ecoregion subsections which intersect the AT: 

1. **Live tree abundance**
  + TPA, BAA, biomass, and carbon by species
2. **Species diversity of live trees**
  + Shannon's diversity, eveness, and richness
3. **Tree vital rates**
  + Annual diameter, basal area, and biomass growth by species
4. **Forest demographic rates**
  + Annual recruitment, mortality, and harvest totals and rates by species
5. **Regeneration abundance**
  + TPA of regenerating stems (<5" DBH) by species and size-class
6. **Snag abundance**
  + TPA, BAA, biomass, carbon, relative fraction
7. **Down woody debris abundance**
  + Volume, biomass, and carbon by fuel class
8. **Invasive Plant abundance**
  + % cover by species
