Andy is a professor at Michigan State University with a joint appointment in the Departments of Forestry and Geography, and is a co-author of `rFIA`. A central theme in his research is the use of hierarchical models to integrate information from disparate sources to improve inference and prediction. In terms of application areas, his research focuses on spatial-temporal modeling of changing ecosystem components and systems.
