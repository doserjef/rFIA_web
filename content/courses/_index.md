Despite being publicly available, FIA data are notoriosly difficult for most non-FIA users to interpret and understand, and there is potential to greatly increase the utilization of these data among industry professionals, academic scientists, and the general public. We created `rFIA` to solve this problem, offering a flexible, user-friendly tool which simplifies the process of working with FIA data and helps ensure this valuable public resource is, well... public. 

In the examples which follow, we will show you the methods which underpin the estimation capacity of `rFIA`. We do not attempt to expain every line of code in the rFIA package here, but rather we present a simplified version to highlight our implementation of the major estimation procedures. You can find the complete source code for rFIA at our <a href="https://github.com/hunter-stanke/rFIA" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.
