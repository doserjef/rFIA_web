# _**Unlocking the FIA Database in R**_

-----------------------------------------


`rFIA` is a user-friendly, open-source R package designed to increase the accessibility and use of the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database. It provides a simple, yet powerful set of tools to easily query and analyze FIA Data. Designed to accommodate a wide range of potential user objectives, `rFIA` simplifies the estimation of forest variables using the FIA Database and allows all R users (experts and newcomers alike) to unlock the flexibility and potential inherent to the Enhanced FIA design.

Whether you are new to FIA or a seasoned veteran, we are excited to share what `rFIA` can offer you. See   #image = "drone_borealCanopy.png"  # Name of image in `static/img/`.
  #image_darken = 0.8 # Darken the image? Range 0-1 where 0 is transparent and 1 is opaque.Example Usage for a primer on using rFIA to streamline your analyses, and check out our current projects to see how we have used rFIA to leverage big data in the FIA Database to address pressing questions in forest management and ecology.
